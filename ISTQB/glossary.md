# ISTQB Glossary (My Words)

- Defect: a flaw in a component/system that can cause failure
- Failure: when the system does not do what the user expects
- Severity: impact of a defect on the system/user
- Priority: how soon it should be fixed (business urgency)
- Regression testing: testing to ensure old features still work after changes
- Smoke testing: quick check that main functions work in a new build
